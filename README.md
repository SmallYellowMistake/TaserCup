# TaserCup
ZAP

I made a Taser Cup using an Arduino Uno R3, a relay module, a liquid sensor, an I2C LCD Screen, a 400kV booster and a button. I programmed a 15 second countdown for people to chug a cup. It should tase you if you don't finish it in time, and congratulate you if you finish it in time.

I used a cone initially, but decided to go with a simple slush puppy container. I also used aluminium foil to cover the sides to make sure the hands get tazed.
